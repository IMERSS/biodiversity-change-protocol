Detecting biodiversity change is a complex challenge, involving many “wicked problems” 
that communities around the world must navigate to make progress toward the goals of 
the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.

Here we present a protocol to address a subset of these problems, with a focus on inferring local extinction, or extirpation.

This protocol is fully developed and implemented in the research article published in [*Plants, Planet, People*](https://www.imerss.org).
Through this documentation, we provide a walk-through of this framework, centering on a tutorial dataset.
