## Detection frequency

Another metric that might be considered in evaluating extirpation risk is detection
frequency or sighting rate. Whether a species was observed only once historically,
or multiple times, before going unreported, might influence our prior belief in the 
likelihood of its persistence or extirpation.

* If there are many records vouching for a species' historical occurrence, we might have
greater confidence that it was a well established population

* If a species is only reported once or twice, historical populations may have been small or non-viable, or perhaps the species 
is simply rare and overlooked

Sighting rates constitute useful prior knowledge and can be used to calculate extinction probabilities.
