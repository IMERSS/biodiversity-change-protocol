## Detection frequency

A useful metric for assessing extirpation risk is the detection frequency or sighting rate of a species. 
Species that were observed only once historically may carry a different likelihood of persistence than 
those observed repeatedly before disappearing from records. In other words, the number and frequency of 
historical observations can inform our prior belief about whether a species is likely still extant or has 
been extirpated.

* If there are many records vouching for a species' historical occurrence, we might have
greater confidence that it was a well established population

* If a species is only reported once or twice, historical populations may have been small or non-viable, or perhaps the species 
is simply rare and overlooked

Sighting rates constitute useful prior knowledge and can be used to calculate extinction probabilities.
