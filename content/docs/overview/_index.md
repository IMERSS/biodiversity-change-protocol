Extinction events are the sum of all extirpation events, with the vanishing of all individuals of a species. Thus, to address the global threat of biodiversity loss, communities must develop systems for the early detection and prevention of extinction as it occurs locally.

The global biodiversity crisis stems from a cascading series of extirpations driving species
toward extinction. Addressing this crisis requires methods for early detection of extinction at
local scales, where communities can mobilise conservation efforts. We present a method for
the detection of species extirpation, harnessing biological specimens, community science, and
targeted surveys. Our framework aligns with IUCN extinction criteria and provides a practical
means of testing the hypothesis of extinction. By streamlining the integration of data into a
practical framework for inference, our approach overcomes key challenges in inferring local
extinction risk, supporting efforts to detect and mitigate biodiversity loss.

Galiano Island local Shauna Anderson documenting a population of *Trifolium dichotomum* on Mount Galiano on 5 June 2022. The species had last been reported from the island based on a herbarium collection made by Harvey Janszen in 1981, and thus had gone undocumented for more than forty years.

We need systems that allow communities to track biodiversity change locally, to curb biodiversity loss at its source.
