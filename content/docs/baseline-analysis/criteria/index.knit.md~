## Open-ended assessments of potential change

In order to proceed beyond an initial baseline analysis to assess possible changes in a system, we can set
criteria to focus our attention (and limited resources) on high risk species that are most likely to be vulnerable.

Depending on the criteria we set, there may emerge many potential target species or populations of concern.
On the first pass, however, it is notable that this decision-making process is blind to any conservation priorities 
we might have (*e.g.*, species assessed as vulnerable at a provincial or national scale), which can bias biodiversity 
change assessments.

## Criteria to consider

### Provenance

First, presumably we are mostly concerned with change in plant communities of native origin:
