## Identifying potential changes

Differences between historical and contemporary biodiversity data could potentially indicate change in a system:

* In conservation assessments, historically reported species that have not been seen within 20--40 years are often considered 
'historical populations' whose persistence is considered questionable ([Nature Serve 2025](https://help.natureserve.org/biotics/Content/Record_Management/Element_Files/Element_Tracking/ETRACK_Definitions_of_Heritage_Conservation_Status_Ranks.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Conversely, species that suddenly appear in a biodiversity record may signal a recent dispersal, colonization or invasion event

Here, we focus specifically on "species at large", *i.e.*, historical reports that have gone undetected in recent decades.
