## Mapping habitat



## Combination of heterogeneous (unstructured) data in baseline analyses

Statistical approaches are often paralyzed by various limitations and deficiencies inherent in biodiversity data.

* Data are commonly unstructured, or heterogeneous
* They are often biased toward detection of positive sightings or occurrences
* They may be collected in ways that violate the assumptions of statistical models
* Data may be sparse, with few or perhaps only singleton records to vouch for historical populations, especially at local scales

A practical approach to this difficult situation is to forego any advanced modeling practices *ab initio*
and begin instead with a simple baseline analysis of historical *vs* contemporary sources of biodiversity data.

## The difference that makes the difference

Differences between historical baseline and contemporary biodiversity data could potential indicate change in the system:

* In conservation assessments, species that have not been seen within XX years are often considered 'historical populations' (XXXX).
* Conversely, species that suddenly appear in a biodiversity record may signal changing communities or population dynamics

Populations or species that have gone undetected for many years may be considered at risk of extirpation.

# Not seen in the last 20 years

## Open-ended assessments of potential change

Through this process, there may emerge many potential target species or populations of concern.
On a first pass approach, however, it is notable that this system is blind to any conservation priorities we may have,
which present potential biases.

Nevertheless, to proceed, it is sensible to set certain criteria on what species might be considered vulnerable, which can be targeted for population assessments.

First, we may only be concerned with the disappearance of native plants from the landscape.

Biological specimens are the strongest evidence we have for biodiversity change assessments.
