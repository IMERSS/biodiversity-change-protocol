Detecting biodiversity change is a non-trivial challenge, posing many "wicked problems" 
that communities around the world must overcome in order to make progress 
toward goals set by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Here we
present a novel protocol for the detection of local extinction events, which offers a practical approach
that communities can use to address a small subset of these problems. The framework
can also be expanded upon and adapted for other applications.

This protocol is fully developed and implemented in the research article published in [*Plants, Planet, People*](https://www.imerss.org).
Through this documentation, we provide a walk-through of this framework, centering on a tutorial dataset.
