Detecting biodiversity change is a complex challenge, involving many “wicked problems” 
that communities around the world must navigate to make progress toward the goals of 
the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.

This protocol is fully developed and implemented in the research article published in [*Plants, Planet, People*](https://www.imerss.org).
Through this documentation, we provide a walk-through of this framework, centering on a tutorial dataset.
