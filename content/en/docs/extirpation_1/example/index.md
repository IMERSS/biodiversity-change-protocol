Before the beginning of the BioGaliano project in 2015, a total of 607 vascular plant species were reported for Galiano Island, represented by 1,698 records, including 446 herbarium specimens (Fig. 1). 
After five years of concerted search effort, amounting to >18,000 observations, we documented 560 species on the project, confirming 433/607 historical species reports (71% of the historically reported diversity) and adding 127 new species to the list.
