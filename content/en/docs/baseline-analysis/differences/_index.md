## Identifying potential changes

Differences between historical baseline and contemporary biodiversity data could potentially indicate change in the system:

* In conservation assessments, species that have not been seen within XX years are often considered 'historical populations' (XXXX)
* Conversely, species that suddenly appear in a biodiversity record may signal changing communities or population dynamics

Here, we focus specifically on "species at large", or historical reports that have gone undetected in recent decades.

```
# Not seen in the last 20 years
```

Populations or species that have gone undetected for many years may be considered at risk of extirpation. 
What other criteria might we consider in an extinction risk assessment?
