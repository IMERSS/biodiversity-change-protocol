## Identifying potential changes

Differences between historical and contemporary biodiversity data could potentially indicate change in a system:

* In conservation assessments, historically reported species that have not been seen within XX years are often considered 
'historical populations' whose persistence is considered questionable (XXXX)
* Conversely, species that suddenly appear in a biodiversity record may signal a recent dispersal, colonization or invasion event

Here, we focus specifically on "species at large", *i.e.*, historical reports that have gone undetected in recent decades.

```
# Not seen in the last 20 years
```

Populations or species that have gone undetected for many years may be considered at risk of extirpation and targeted for assessment.
However, there are other important criteria that communities may consider before undertaking such efforts.
