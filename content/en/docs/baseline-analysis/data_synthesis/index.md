## Combination of heterogeneous data in baseline analyses

Statistical approaches to modeling biodiversity change are often paralyzed by limitations and deficiencies inherent
in biodiversity dataâ€”especially when historical and contemporary data are combined from multiple sources.

* Data are commonly unstructured, or heterogeneous, lacking consistent attributes or metadata
* Data are often biased toward positive detections (lacking absence information)
* Data may be collected in ways that violate the assumptions of statistical models
* Georeferencing is often generalized based on vague locality information
* Data may be sparse, with few or perhaps only singleton records to vouch for historical populations, especially at local scales

## Baseline analyses offer a practical approach

A practical approach to this difficult situation is to forego any advanced modeling practices *ab initio*
and begin instead with a simple baseline analysis of historical *vs* contemporary sources of biodiversity data.
This depends on normalization of species occurrence data to support the comparison of historical and contemporary species records.

Normalization of biodiversity data is a thorny enough problem in its own right and not treated here. For this
tutorial we assume that names are aligned and any synonymy is resolved between the data being compared.

* Best practices are to adhere to the Darwin Core standard for species occurrence data.
* Different communities may prefer to adhere to different taxonomic databases. Any taxonomic standard can be observed, as 
long as it results in consistent mapping of taxa between datasets.
