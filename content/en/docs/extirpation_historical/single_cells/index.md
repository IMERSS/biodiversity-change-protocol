## What constitutes a complete search?

Unless one has data to calculate detection probabilities, it is not possible
to fit a fully probabilistic model to solve this problem. Hence, we must resort
to a heuristic: how much effort do we need to exhaust in an area before we are satisfied
that our search is complete?

{{% imgproc beta_sweep Fill "6000x4000" %}}
{{% /imgproc %}}

For this thought experiment, the appropriate unit of analysis is at the cell level.

Imagine yourself in a 30x30m area (better yet, get out into the field!)
How much time do you think you need to adequately search this area?

There are many factors to consider here, including the size of the target organism
and the complexity of its environment. Moreover,

Best practices for species inventory and rare species surveys recommend 
intuitive searches...
