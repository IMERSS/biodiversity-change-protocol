To meet global standards set for inferring extinction, the practical application 
of statistical inference must be framed around criteria set out by the International 
Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2012) for the assessment of extinction events. 

The IUCN defines a taxon as ‘presumed extinct’ (in our case, equivalent to extirpated—or 
locally extinct) “when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at 
appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have 
failed to record an individual.” 

However, it remains a major challenge to determine the evidentiary thresholds implied by these criteria (‘exhaustive’, ‘expected’, 
‘appropriate’), not only to clarify the formal requirements for claims regarding 
extirpation but also to inform effective search methods and to assess the feasibility 
of meeting these requirements.
